# Yanisa's Portfolio

Yanisa's Portfolio is a portfolio website showcasing the work of my friend, Yanisa Bhisitcharoentat, a talented UX/UI designer. The website is available at https://ysnyanisa.com.

## Tech Stack

This project uses a number of key libraries and cloud services, including:

- **ReactJS**, a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**, a routing library for React that provides a way to navigate between different components of the application.
- **Redux Toolkit**, a set of tools built on top of the Redux state management library that simplifies common Redux use cases.
- **Firebase**, a platform that provides various cloud services and tools for app development.
  - **Cloud Firestore**, a NoSQL cloud database that stores and syncs data.
  - **Cloud Storage**, a cloud-based storage solution for various types of files.

## Status

Yanisa's Portfolio is currently up and running. However, as new design updates from Ms. Yanisa become available, the project will be updated to reflect the latest changes.

## Acknowledgment

Ms. Yanisa Bhisitcharoentat is the creative force behind the user interface of this project. Her design file can be accessed on Figma at [Yanisa's Portfolio UI](https://www.figma.com/file/Wh24nUzbjHJAz56U4bX2AU/Yanisa's-Portfolio?node-id=0%3A1&t=3obSz3n4zhH2A4jw-1).

## Roadmap

To keep up with the constantly updating information on this project, my future plan is to develop an admin panel that allows for easy updates to elements such as work, certificates, and contact information. This will be a website (possibly hosted at https://admin.ysnyanisa.com) with access to modify the Firebase Cloud Firestore and Firebase Cloud Storage that store the data used in the project. Ms. Yanisa will be able to update her information without needing external help, making this portfolio website more dynamic.
